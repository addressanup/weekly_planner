# Plan: Weekly Canvas Frontend

## Goals
- Scaffold a modern React + TypeScript frontend ready for weekly canvas development.
- Establish UI layout, drag-and-drop interactions, and task management foundations.
- Ensure responsive styling, mock data flows, and smoke tests for reliability.

## Steps
1. Initialize frontend project structure using Vite (React + TS) with workspace alignment.
2. Configure project tooling: ESLint, Prettier, TailwindCSS, utility libs (date-fns), React Query/Zustand.
3. Implement layout: weekly grid component, day columns, swimlanes, responsive behavior.
4. Add state (Zustand/Context) for tasks, weeks, categories; mock data + persistence stubs.
5. Implement task cards with metadata chips; integrate drag-and-drop (React DnD or DnD Kit).
6. Build floating tasks panel & quick-add (natural-language parser stub), theme presets.
7. Add Pomodoro timer placeholder & focus indicator.
8. Implement tests (React Testing Library, Vitest), Storybook stories, docs.
